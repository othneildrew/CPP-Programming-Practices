/***
Referring to the truth table of logical operators, for the following segment
of code:
**/ 

if (Input1_1 && Input2)
    cout << " output is TRUE";
else ()
    cout << " output is FALSE";

// Explanation: Is it AND or OR? Why?
// Returns TRUE. The AND operator returns true if all operantds are true;
// otherwise it retruns false. Assuming that same value is assigned to values
// in test condition, the statement returns true.
