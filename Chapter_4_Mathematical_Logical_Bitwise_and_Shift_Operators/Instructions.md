# Programming Practices

1. Write a C++ program to read two negative numbers. Display two numbers. Find absolute value of each number using abs(input) function of math.h library.
2. Write a C++ rogram to read an integer number and its exponent. Store the result of the number to the power of its exponent and display it. Use pow(input) function of math.h library.
3. Write a C++ program to read a diamter of a circle. Find perimeter and area of the circle.
```
Perimeter = Diameter * PI
Area = R² * PI or Area = pow(R,2) * PI
Radius = Diamter / 2
```
4. Write a C++ program to read length, width, and height of a cube and find its volume. Display the volume.
`Volume = Length * Width * Height`
5. Write a C++ program to read three side of a triangle. Display three sides. Use Pythagorean theory to find if the traingle is a right triangle. Display true if it is a right triangle; otherwise display false.
`Pythagorean theory: a² = b² + c²`
